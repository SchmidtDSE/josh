# Josh Simulation Engine Guide

Welcome to the Josh Simulation Engine tutorial series. These tutorials will guide you through creating ecological simulations using Josh, a domain-specific language designed for vegetation and agent-based modeling.

## Tutorial Series

### Beginner Tutorials
Learn the basics of Josh interface and core concepts.

1. **[Hello Grid](hello.md)** - Introduction to Josh interface and basic simulation concepts
2. **[Data Integration](data.md)** - Working with external geospatial data sources

### Intermediate Tutorials
Explore multi-species modeling and spatial interactions.

3. **[Two Trees](two_trees.md)** - Multiple species modeling and competitive interactions
4. **[State Management](states.md)** - Entity states and behavioral transitions

### Advanced Tutorials
Master complex dynamics and tool integration workflows.

5. **[Fire Dynamics](grass_shrub_fire.md)** - Disturbance modeling and fire effects
6. **[Python Integration](python.md)** - Analysis workflows using Python
7. **[Command Line Tools](cli.md)** - Preprocessing and batch execution
