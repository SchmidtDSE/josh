# Tutorial

These examples are meant to serve as documentation on "toy" models. These are not meant to be ecologically complete or validated but show how to use the features of Josh in a realistic setting. Some of these are also featured on the project website. That said, these are not run in integration tests like `features` and `simulations`.
