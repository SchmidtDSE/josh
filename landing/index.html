        <h2><span aria-hidden="true" class="icon">üëã</span> Hello from Josh!</h2>
        <p>Josh provides easy to use tools for vegitation modeling that lets anyone build scalable simulations. Craft models in your browser, run and refine them on your computer, and distribute them into the cloud. This open source project lets you execute simple equations with spatial data or define sophisticated agentic models scaling into the millions of agents. Josh makes it both easier to get started in vegitation modeling tasks and easier to take your science into big data.</p>

        <p>You don't need to install anything to use Josh - you just need a browser. Open our private web IDE means you can start programming in Josh using simple getting started tutorials in minutes. Specific to vegitation modeling but easy to learn, give Josh lang a try and explore how this open platform can serve you.</p>

        <p>Josh was developed to support cross-disciplinary collaboration through cross-disciplinary collaboration. It is offered as a open source project that prioritizes your freedom. No matter where your science takes you, Josh can follow along to help. Take the project into Python notebooks, tag along into your Java applications, and into your classroom as you teach those just starting in their modeling or programming journeys.</p>
