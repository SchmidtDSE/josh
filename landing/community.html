        <h2><span aria-hidden="true" class="icon">‚ù§Ô∏è</span> A team of fellow modelers.</h2>
        <p>Josh started as a project in the Schmidt Center for Data Science and Environment at the University of California Berkeley. We built it to help facilitate cross-disciplinary collaboration between teammates working on vegitation modeling, specifically in the Mojave. We found that expressing our ideas in general purpose languages required software engineering complexity that left some out. Additionally, we found that juggling different geospatial formats could slow down the pace of progress. Finally, we identified that long running simulations can inhibit experimention but that cloud infrastructure can require a lot of work to accomodate new models. Josh is our answer.</p>

        <h2><span aria-hidden="true" class="icon">üåé</span> Josh is open source.</h2>
        <p>Josh is open source. You can run it on your own brower, computer, server, data center all with minimal configuration and no license fees. Choosing community software means that you are entrusting your work to a community bigger than one team. Go see the BSD-3-Clause Licensed code for yourself!</p>

        <h2><span aria-hidden="true" class="icon">üöÑ</span> We run a cloud for the community.</h2>
        <p>We also run Josh Cloud as a community resource. If you are interested in using it for distributed jobs which let you run multiple replicates in parallel, please reach out - we would love to see if we can add you! It's free and respects your privacy but limited access spots are available. We are prioritizing academic, scientific, non-profit, and government community members. That said, we provide Josh so that you can run it in any environment that supports either WebAssembly or Java. It has self-contained leader and worker nodes such that you can use different hosting solutions and load balancers in your own cloud. We're happy to help discuss those self-hosted pathways as well.</p>
