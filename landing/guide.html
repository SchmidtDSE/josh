        <h2><span aria-hidden="true" class="icon">üåê</span> Hello Grid!</h2>
        <p>In this first tutorial, we explore the building blocks of a Josh simulation. This sets the stage so that you have the basic building blocks in mind before we tackle more realisitc simulations.</p>

        <h2><span aria-hidden="true" class="icon">üî•</span>Grass, shrub, fire.</h2>
        <p>With the basic ideas in place, we next turn to bringing outside data into your simulations. In this case, we will look at adding precipiation projections using a patch-based approach which can take formulas you already use and make them geospatially aware.</p>

        <h2><span aria-hidden="true" class="icon">üå≤</span> Two Trees.</h2>
        <p>Next, we look at agent-based modeling where the system is not just tracking patches on a grid and running calculations for each based on data but simulating individual organisms. This step can also take advantage of some of Josh's important scalable computational machinery.</p>

        <h2><span aria-hidden="true" class="icon">üíæ</span> Bring your own data.</h2>
        <p>The tutorials primarily provide the data to you in a format Josh already knows about. These jshd files are internally optimized representations that make sure Josh simulations run quickly and safely. This next tutorial shows how to bring geotiffs / COGs and netCDFs into your work so that you can explore almost any geospatial dataset.</p>

        <h2><span aria-hidden="true" class="icon">üîÄ</span> Using states.</h2>
        <p>Introduce the concepts of states into agents for more sophisticated modeling. In this example, we show agents using states to describe different behaviors dependent on lifecycle stage.</p>

        <h2><span aria-hidden="true" class="icon">üêç</span> Talking to Josh from Python.</h2>
        <p>The browser-based IDE offers a great place to get started but often workflows need to eventually make their way into other tools. We start out exploration outside the Josh IDE by looking at how Python can work with simulations.</p>

        <h2><span aria-hidden="true" class="icon">üíª</span> Josh on the Command Line.</h2>
        <p>Finally, Josh is written in Java and can be run on the command line as part of broader multi-language workflows. This concluding tutorial looks at how to set up and run Josh as a stand-alone application, including through the command line.</p>
